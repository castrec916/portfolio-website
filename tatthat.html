            <p> According to IBIS World, for 2018 there are at least 54K tattoo artists in the world. Yet those artists are hard to locate all in one place as their information is spread all over social media and personal websites.

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> Users need to easily view clientele and tattoo artists' ratings and rates in any given area so that they feel safe in knowing what to expect; whether they are searching for new clientele, local, traveling, or global tattoo artist. Our
              users also want to be able to preview how a tattoo design will look on their own skin, no matter their skin tone.

              <p>We will know this to be true when we see users build up their content on the application, and by the number of downloads around the world.
              </p>

            <h2>Potential Solutions</h2>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> Make an app that provides a solution to those issues:
              <ul>
                <li>Lead users through a superimposition tool</li>
                <li>Create a means of easily finding local, global and traveling tattoo artists</li>
                <li>Allow users to easily shop for clientele and/or tattoo artists</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div>

            <h2>Ideation</h2>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>User-Centered Design Process</h3>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> It’s important to check out the competition! SWOT analysis for the two most highly rated tattoo design/search application: Tattoodo and Ink Hunter
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>I met users in spaces they felt the most comfortable in, usually in the company of a tasty cup of coffee. Then, after multiple user interviews it was found that there are two distinct groups of users:
              <ul>
                <li>Tattoo Artist</li>
                <li>Tattoo Collector</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Using the insight gathered from user interviews, we were able to generate design persona journey maps for the Tattoo Artist and Collector.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Users are the epicenter of making this process manageable and worthwhile. TatThat was built with their input at the heart of the application.
